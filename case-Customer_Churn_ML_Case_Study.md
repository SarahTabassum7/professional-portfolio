# Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning) – Case Study

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using supervised machine learning to support customer retention and revenue protection strategies.

## Business Problem
High customer attrition was impacting long-term growth and profitability. Business teams lacked reliable early indicators to identify at-risk customers and intervene proactively.

## Objectives
- Predict customer churn probability
- Identify key drivers of attrition
- Support targeted retention campaigns
- Improve customer lifetime value

## Data
- Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (IBM Sample)
- Features: Demographics, service usage, contract type, billing, payment methods
- Size: ~7,000 customer records

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Logistic Regression model development
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Business interpretation of results

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## Model Performance
- Strong classification accuracy
- Balanced precision and recall
- Interpretable coefficients for business insights

## Results & Insights
- Identified high-risk churn segments
- Highlighted impact of contract type and tenure
- Supported data-driven retention planning

## Business Impact
- Enabled proactive customer engagement
- Reduced reactive churn management
- Improved retention strategy design
- Supported revenue protection initiatives
