# Uber Ride Allocation Optimization (Case Study)

## Project Summary
A data-driven project focused on improving ride allocation efficiency by analyzing demand patterns, driver availability, and dispatch delays using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## My Role
Data Analyst

## Key Responsibilities
- Collected, cleaned, and analyzed ride and driver datasets to identify demandâ€“supply imbalances.
- Built regression-based forecasting models in Python to predict demand across locations and time periods.
- Designed Power BI dashboards to visualize allocation delays, demand trends, and driver utilization.
- Performed scenario analysis to evaluate the impact of driver repositioning rules and allocation policies.

## Achievements & Impact
- Reduced ride assignment delays through predictive insights and optimized allocation logic.
- Improved driver utilization efficiency and reduced wait times for high-demand locations.
- Enabled operations teams to make informed decisions through clear data visualizations and insights.

## Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Power BI, Excel
